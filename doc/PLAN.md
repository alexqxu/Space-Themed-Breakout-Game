### Breakout Variant
In Super Breakout, I thought the variation in ?durability? for different blocks was 
interesting, and increased the difficulting of the game, requiring players to use more 
creativity and strategy to pass certain levels. In addition, power-ups like score boosts,
 multiple balls, and laser shots enhanced the game experience by adding game mechanisms. 
 This made the game more interesting and less mundane.

I also liked the puzzle strategy mechanism in Bricks n Balls. It allows the player to 
aim and strategize what is the best course of action based on the remaining ?health? 
of certain blocks to be cleared. In addition, the blocks are constant regenerated in a 
scrolling fashion, and the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible without 
the blocks scrolling to the bottom of the screen (which contrasts with the classic 
Breakout game, where there are levels to be cleared).
